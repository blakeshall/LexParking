LexParking
==========
Short Description:
-----------------
Online map using the Google Maps API to show parking spots in downtown Lexington, KY.
Currently there are only five areas denoted in the app that I hand drew. The plan is to add more areas and possibly see if LexPark will provide geographic data, number of parking spaces, and any other useful info.

Use:
----
Click on a marker to see the parking area (shown as a polygon), as well as the number of spaces and time limit for that area.

As it is all in Javascript and using the Google Maps API it can be used on mobile devices as well. It can also be resized/embedded in any web page.

TODO
----
* Custom marker images to distinguish areas using regular meters and areas using Pay & Display stations.
* Add more parking areas
* If Lexpark is able/willing to allow access to what I assume is a database of the parking spaces then I maybe able to do things such as show the number of empty spaces, time till the next space is free, and even the nearest open space if on a mobile device with GPS capabilities.
